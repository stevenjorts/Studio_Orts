  The BMW <a href="http://www.blog.iso50.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CSL-8.jpg">3.0 CSL</a> triggers <a href="pathonestriking.html">memories</a> of the first <a href="pathonevictory.html">victory</a> for the company at the 12 Hours of Sebring in <a href="index.html">1975</a>. The last time BMW raced an <a href="http://www.bmwartcarcollection.com/2011/05/17-jeff-koons-bmw-art-car/">art car</a> at Le Mans was in 2010: the <a href="pathonestriking.html">striking</a> #79 <a href="http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/jeff-koons-m3-art-car-5.jpg">M3</a> GT designed by artist Jeff Koons. Then there was the <a href="http://media.caranddriver.com/images/12q4/491024/bmw-m1-photo-492604-s-1280x782.jpg">M1</a>, the first car developed by BMW for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the eighties.
